# Building a ubiquitous dev environment

Monday, 05 February 2024. 14:01:52GMT

I'm trying to build a ubiquitous development setup. One where I could login to any linux machine
(either physically or via ssh), pull down my configuration files, and be ready to work within
minutes.

This will require everything I need to be able to work in an environment that has no window manager
or desktop display.

I heard about the idea of using a remote machine as a work computer. Just spinning it up
(on Digital Ocean for example) and setting up dotfiles and being away and running.

Love this idea.
