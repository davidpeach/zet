# David Peach's Homepage

My new homepage is in its infancy. My old website is currently offline and is a WordPress site with about 1500 posts.
Mostly me just drivveling on.

I'm slowly migrating to a fully static website setup, starting with my [Zettlekasten-inspired knowledge base](./zet/) which I am
making public.
