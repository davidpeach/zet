# I'm going back to Vim

Sunday, 04 February 2024. 22:55:50GMT

I got into Vim through Neovim and have loved my experience so far.

And I do still like Neovim.

But something in me yearns for a cleaner setup. And setup that uses regular Vim. As great as Neovim is, something about the lean
towards giving it an "IDE-like" experience doesn't sit right with me. I'm not saying aiming for IDE-like functionality is bad at all.

I just want each of my tools to do one thing, and one thing well.

Maybe I'm just a sucker for punishment.

I've got my `.vimrc` file down to 117 lines with 9 plugins. 2 of those plugins are database related (until I can find a better 
cli-based database client than vim-dadbod). Another 2 are for LSP integration. Yes I know I said about not wanting IDE-like 
things, but when working with code all day a decent level of code intelligence is needed. This doesn't mean it needs AI tools
and built in snippets and integrated debugging and testing.

I believe other pieces of functionality I may come to need - like snippets - could be handled by using unix filters. More on 
that in a future zet.

I'll see how I get on and report back in about a week.
