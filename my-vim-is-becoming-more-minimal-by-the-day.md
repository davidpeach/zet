# My vim is becoming more minimal by the day

## Preface
Let me preface this by saying I think Neovim and it's surrounding ecosystem is incredible.
It was also my gateway into vim.

But I have been peeling back the layers of all of the fancy, and very clever, plugins to get down
to what I really want my editing experience to be.

I will link my old stats and new stats soon to see a comparison.

## My current VIM setup:

- 125 lines `.vimrc` file.
- 10 plugins:
  - **sheerun/vim-polyglot** ( Code highlighting for many languages/filetypes )
  - **tpope/vim-fugitive** ( Excellent tool for working with git )
  - **tpope/vim-commentary** ( Easy code commenting )
  - **tpope/vim-dadbod** ( The only decent, working terminal DB client I have found )
  - **kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-ui** ( UI for my DB client )
  - **christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator** ( Enable easy movement between VIM and Tmux )
  - **morhetz/gruvbox** ( My Theme )
  - **prabirshrestha/vim-lsp** ( Language Server Support )
  - **mattn/vim-lsp-settings** ( Help setup of LSP settings )
  - **iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim** ( Live previewing markdown files )
