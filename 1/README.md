## What is a "zettelkasten"?

A Zettlekasten is a method for note-taking, which traditionally would be done by adding said notes to small slips of paper / card.
It has been popularised by many famous people, some of which I will link below when i get chance.

## This isn't a blog?

Nope. Not really.

As i see it, a blog is a reverse-chronological series of posts - usually accompanied with a date / timestamp.

I have kept a blog of sorts for about 10 years or so. It's a mixture of notes imported from my old Twitter account (RIP).
It's hosted using WordPress and I'm still undecided what to do with it.

My ambition now is to move towards this more-Zettlekasten-style of writing.

They will be single markdown files of notes / sometimes longer-form writing on various topics.

The index will be in order of most recently updated. As opposed to most recently published.

My thinking behind favouring the updated date over the published date is that I will keep information up-to-date,
as opposed to the blog-style of posts in the past essentially being snapshots in time. While the idea of snapshots
in time is an interesting one, and one that made me want to keep a blog in the first place, I think I'd prefer letting
my posts / notes be their own entities that are not tied to a point in time when they were created.

After-all, opinions and methods change and it's silly to keep outdated content around when it can just be updated.
